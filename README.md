# evolution
The prey feed on the grass to build their energy. Once fed, they can reproduce by finding a suitably fed partner, using the energy store to create an offspring with similar but randomly altered characteristics.
The predators chase the prey, catching and eating them for energy. They then reproduce in the same way.
Moving costs energy, so if either predators or prey don't get enough food, they will die.
Each animal will slowly evolve in an arms race to be faster, bigger or more aware.
